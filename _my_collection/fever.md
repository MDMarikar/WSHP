## key message

always refer children < 3 months of age with fever for paediatric assessment.


The NICE fever in under 5 guidance is good - in particular traffic light table is an excellent practical quick reference resource and there is a link to a pdf and online learning here and safety net resources

Always refer babies with recorded fever either by parents or healthcare professionals under 3 months 

Beware and have low threshold to refer multiple repeat presentations with parental concern 

Expose appropriately every child for non blanching rash and review and document that a child is not meningitis

Neonates are not to be trusted if you have any infection concerns have a low threshold for referral

Always check for incomplete vaccination status and consider if the child is immunocompromised as they are in a higher risk category.  Children with Downâ€™s syndrome have increased risk for infections
