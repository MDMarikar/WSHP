# Key Messages

- Most eczema is not allergy-driven, and food exclusion carries potential risks such as nutrient deficiencies and increased allergy development.
- IgE-mediated food allergies are characterized by a rash (usually hives) appearing within an hour of eating a specific food and usually clearing completely with antihistamine use.
- Active eczema management, including daily care and prevention measures, is essential.
- Early weaning, as per BSACI guidance, may benefit babies with eczema from the first 1-2 months of life

# What to Do

## History Review:
Identify timing of rash onset, specific triggering food, nature of rash, and resolution method. IgE-mediated allergies usually involve hives appearing within an hour of eating and clearing completely with antihistamine.
## Eczema Management:
Implement aggressive daily routine including moderate-temperature baths, emollient application, mild to moderate topical corticosteroid use during flare-ups, and protective clothing at night.
## Dietary Management:
If food triggers are suspected, maintain a food diary and perform a careful food exclusion and reintroduction process. Emphasize the importance of food reintroduction due to the lack of reliable diagnostic tests for food-triggered eczema.

# What Not to Do

Avoid IgE or skin prick testing for children with eczema without IgE symptoms to prevent confusion and unnecessary dietary restrictions.

# When to Refer

- If eczema is difficult to control, refer to a dermatology service.
- If symptoms indicate an IgE-mediated food allergy, refer with details to an allergy clinic.
- If the child is excluding significant foods like milk or wheat, refer to a dietetic service.

# Potential Risks of Food Exclusion

- Potential nutrient deficiencies and increased allergy development are key concerns. Balancing food exclusion with these potential risks should be discussed. The importance of food reintroduction is paramount in managing food-triggered eczema flare-ups.
