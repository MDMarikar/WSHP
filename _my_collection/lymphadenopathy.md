Children with palpable cervical lymph nodes

**Key Messages:**

- Palpable cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) in children are in most cases not pathological
- Small palpable CLNs (<1 cm) are generally considered physiological and can remain for several months without concern.
- Persistent CLNs  less than 2cm don’t require referral as some never completely disappear - if fluctuating with intercurrent illness and not progressively enlarging we can be reassured
- Neck ultrasound have should not be used routinely to screen healthy children with palpable CLNs

**What to Do:**

- conduct a comprehensive history and clinical assessment - this  is important to look for out infectious causes (ask about  travel history and TB contacts) and identify any signs pointing towards malignancy.
- A short history of illness with localised warm, red, tender lymph node is in keeping with lymphadenitis - if small and  the child is systematically well a 10 day course of co-amoxiclav with interval review can be considered.  Refer acutely if not or concerned.
- Look for periodontal disease which can cause lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis and examine the scalp (cradle cap/eczema)

**When to Refer:**

- If a child has CLNs larger than 2 cm that persist for over 6 weeks, they should be referred to secondary care
