The consensus appears to be moving towards tolerating proctocolitis in infants who are breast fed and not suggesting any exclusion in mother's diet.
yes, we sometimes see this in otherwise healthy babies who ar lol e breastfed that they have a bit of blood or snot in their poo. This always settles in a few months and does not do the baby any harm. Previously we used to suggest mum stopping milk in her diet but there is no good evidence to say this is the cause or stopping helps. So it's ok to ignore it.
