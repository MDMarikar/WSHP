# Key Messages

Was thinking of sending message as follows 

# 1. Key Messages

- Urinary incontinence, defined as day wetting in a child over 5 years of age that occurs more than once per month for more than 3 months, affects 1 in 7 children aged 4 years and 1 in 20 children aged 9 years.
- It usually does not have an underlying structural or neurological cause.
- The most common functional causes include voiding postponement, overactive bladder (OAB), underactive bladder, and dysfunctional voiding.

# What to Do

**Investigate** taking a detailed history of urinary symptoms, any night time symptoms, voiding patterns, and history of constipation. Examine the child's growth, blood pressure, abdomen, lumbar spine, neurology exam, and genitalia. Perform urine analysis and renal tract ultrasound to look for structural causes

**Manage and Treat** by encouraging behavioural modification like increasing fluid intake, avoiding bladder irritants, and treating co-existing conditions like constipation, urinary tract infection, and enuresis. 

**active bladder training**, which involves scheduled voiding (every 2-3 hours while awake), double voiding, avoiding holding maneuvers, and teaching the child to fully empty their bladder. This process aims to improve bladder control and decrease the frequency of incontinence.

Provide the parents with relevant information and support eg ERIC website 

# When to Refer

Refer to secondary care or paediatric continence service when:

- An anatomical abnormality is suspected (e.g. continuous wetting)
- Urine analysis is abnormal
- No improvement is seen after 3 months of active bladder training
- Giggle incontinence symptoms are not improving with age
- Underactive bladder symptoms are not improving after 3 months of aggressive treatment of constipation and voiding training
