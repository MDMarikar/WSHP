Paediatric Patients with neutropenia are at high risk for infection and should not be prescribed suppositories to treat constipation due to potential risk of bacterial translocation with mucosal damage 

Probably unlikely to be done in primary care for paediatric oncology patients and apologies if this is well known however I thought itâ€™s best not to assume !
