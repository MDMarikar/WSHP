# Concerns about head shapes in infant
Concerns around abnormal head are not uncommon.  The majority will have normal variants (such as positional plagiocephaly and benign metopic ridge) but it is important to assess for craniosynostosis by looking at the babies head from above and refer directly from primary care to a specialist centre early if concerned
 

# Differentiating Craniosynostosis from Normal Variants 
Look at the overall head shape from above and position of ears relative to each other.  See figures below - in positional plagiocephaly the ear and forehead on the ipsilateral side to the flattening will be anteriorly placed

Metopic craniosynostosis differs from a simple metopic ridge by absence of forehead flattening, creating a triangular shape.
		

# Key Points on Clinical Assessment
History should include timing and progression of abnormal head shape, symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, antenatal, neonatal and family history

Physical examination should assess head shape (front, above and side), head circumference, anterior fontanelle, any ridges or bulges, and associated dysmorphic features or anomalies.
		
# What to Do If Craniosynostosis is Suspected 
If craniosynostosis is suspected and no acute concerns refer directly to a specialist  craniofacial unit - in our case Oxford Craniofacial Unit.  Details on referral advice and guidance contacts available here  ![Oxfor Craniofacial Team](https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/craniofacial/)

If you are clinically uncertain about a diagnosis, contact the craniofacial unit, sharing patient photographs, to discuss the case.


# Why Time Matters
Early diagnosis and intervention - before 6 months of age ideally -  is crucial to avoid limitations on surgical options as the child ages and skull bones become less male .
