There is a National Primary Clinical Care Pathway for constipation in children.  There seems to be a lot to read but infographic that is produced is quite useful to both secondary and primary care to highlight the importance and remember to give clear guidance to parents on

* continuing maintenance laxatives for chronic constipation for at least 3-6 months
* titrate carefully down after that 
* never stop abruptly 
* take extra care and have a lower threshold for action for
children with disabilities including learning disabilities due to being more prone to constipation.
