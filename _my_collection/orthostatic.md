Many children can have symptoms such as dizziness and other symptoms (which can include palpitations) on standing.  

The majority of children do not have cardiac pathologies and one approach is to use orthostatic intolerance as a broad diagnostic category.  The following information leaflet has some useful patient guidance https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/patients/services/clinical_depts/paediatric_cfs_me/documents/PCFS015_Orthostatic_Intolerance_Explained.pdf

The leaflet is labelled as part of ME/CFS service guidance but has useful general principles on mobilisation and “blood pumping” actions, fluid and salt intake

POTS UK has succint guidance on assessment for this condition https://www.potsuk.org/pots-for-medics/gp-guide/
