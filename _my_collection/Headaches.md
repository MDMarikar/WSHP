# Key Messages

- Headaches are common in children, increasing from early childhood to adolescence.
- Chronic daily headache is defined as a headache experienced for over 15 days/month for 3 consecutive months.
- Headaches can be primary (no specific underlying cause) or secondary (due to underlying conditions such as hypertension or sinusitis). Primary headaches are more common in children.
- Brain tumors are rare but remain a differential diagnosis for headaches in children. Use the Head Smart Decision Support Tool to identify alerting features.
- Be aware of medication overuse headaches, a condition caused by regular, long-term use of medication to treat headaches, which can worsen instead of improving the condition.

# What To Do
- Take a comprehensive history including headache details, medication history (paying attention to potential medication overuse), school absences, sleep habits, screen time, stress, and family headache history.
- Physical exam: measure and plot weight, height, blood pressure; check for potential dental, eye, ENT pathologies, including sinusitis, and perform a neurological assessment.
- Advise a visit to an optometrist to rule out visual problems potentially causing/contributing to the headaches.
- Provide lifestyle advice, including screen time and sleep hygiene, for managing headaches. Stress the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake.
- Encourage the use of a headache diary to identify triggers.
- For migraines, refer to NICE guidelines for management and consider psychological therapies when required.

# When To Refer

- Utilize the [Head Smart Decision Support Tool](https://www.headsmart.org.uk/clinical/decision-support-tool/?cache=clear) for assistance in deciding when to refer.
- Make an urgent referral if a child shows red flags like waking up due to the headache, persistent vomiting, focal neurological signs, coordination problems, behavioral changes, or progressively severe headaches.
- Have a lower threshold for referring children under 5 with chronic symptoms.
