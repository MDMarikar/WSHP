layout: simple

# Key Messages

- ARFID is a recognized diagnosis based on ICD11 and DSM5, with specific criteria. It describes a broad range of children, focusing on those who are nutritionally compromised.
- ARFID isn't solely about limited food intake but involves a deeper understanding of what drives a child to restrict their diet.
- Specialist ARFID services are currently limited and difficult to access.
- The ARFID label should be applied judiciously, as it can cause undue stress and confusion, especially if used too broadly.

# What to Do

- **Investigation**: Monitor the child's weight and consider checking nutritional levels by evaluating FBC, vitamin D, and ferritin.
- **Management**: 
  - For children with autism:
    - **preschool non verbal young children with learning disability:** Provide reassurance and support around food chaining and maintaining weight. 
    - **School-aged, cognitively able children**: They may have a limited but adequate diet. Provide reassurance and small suggestions for improvement. 
    - **Children with significant dietary restriction**: May require specialist support, especially if their growth is compromised.
  - Advise families to minimize worry and encourage the child to try similar but varied foods. Recommend an over the counter multivitamin.
  - If the child exhibits a strong fear of eating, consider seeking specialist support.
- **Co-existing Conditions**: Recognize the influence of other conditions eg autism. Tailor support and interventions accordingly.

# When to Refer

- Consider referral to dieticians if there's significant weight loss or a markedly poor diet.
- If mental health issues like anxiety are present, consider referral to psychological services.
- there are current challenges in accessing specialist ARFID services
