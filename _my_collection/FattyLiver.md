**Key Messages:**
- Incidental “Fatty Liver” findings found in abdominal ultrasound in children usually indicate Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), commonly associated with obesity.

- NAFLD is on a spectrum of disease and may lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver failure if not managed early.

**What to Do:**
- **History & Examination:** 

Patients may complain of fatigue and persistent RUQ pain. 

Change in cognitive ability including memory’s or language should raise index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses - eg Wilson’s disease

Assess obesity and hepatomegaly.  Assess for signs of chronic liver disease 

- **Investigations:** 
Check blood pressure 

FBC, UEs, LFTs (split bili, ALT, AST, GGT), fasting lipid profile, HbA1c.

- **Lifestyle Management:** Advise on diet and physical activity. Refer to local health services like Suffolk’s Healthy Living Service for nutritional and weight management support.  This should be expedited if raised AST/ALT

**When to Refer:**
- **All Cases:** Refer all children with fatty liver findings on ultrasound
- **Expedited Referral:** Expedited referral for abnormal findings or if BMI is not raised eg less than 91st centile

- **Additional Tests (usually Secondary Care but to consider with expedited referral ):** Coagulation screen, TFTs, coeliac serology, hepatitis serology, liver autoantibodies, Wilson's disease testing (caeruloplasmin, serum copper) for uncertain diagnoses or red flags.
